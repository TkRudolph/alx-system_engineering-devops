Learning the basics of shell scripting
the following scripts/files are what I'm working on 
0(prints working dir)
1(display content list of cd)
2(changes working dir to the user's home dir)
3(display current dir in long format)
4(display current dir including hidden files using long format)
5(display current dir contents)
this list is getting too long imma wrap it up once i'm done:)
